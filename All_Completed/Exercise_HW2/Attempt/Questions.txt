Part 1
    1. My takeway from the MQTT was from earlier as I used it in
    Engineering applications, and in there we also used MQTT 
    and it is a lot simpler and smoother than others. After handling 
    a couple errors you can get a good connection which you can 
    subscribe and publish using topics.

    2. The loop_forever would block the script and nothing will execute 
    as the code keeps running. while using the loop_start and stop itll run
    the loop in differeint threads allowing the rest to keep going.
    If it was a whole application it would never run as loop_forever
    would stop any code from running. This just shows how the loop_start
    method is much more flexible.

Part 2
    To solve the lunar lander v2 the agent sees the game state and chooses
    the best action using a neural network that estimates Q values for each move.
    Then the agent stores the expereince in a replay buffer and trains, this helps 
    learning from correlated data. Over time the agent learnns and improves by minimizing
    the difference between the predicted Q value and the target values. it also gets in the epsilon 
    greedy selection allowing it to explore more early and use what it learned.
